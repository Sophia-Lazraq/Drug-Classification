Providing the right molecule at the right concentration is a crucial point for the chemiotherapy to be successful.
The aim of this challenge is to classify (4 classes) chemiotherapy molecules and predict their concentration based on 
their e Raman spectra.


## Classification:
Predict the molecule present in the solution (Classes A, B, C, D)

## Regression:
Predict the concentration of the molecules

## Evaluation
0/1 lossfor classification, MARE for regression and a final combined error :
Combined: 2/3 * classifier + 1/3 * regressor
